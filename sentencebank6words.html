    <li><span class="sentence">Somebody's going to the car now.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I'm going to examine him first.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Haven't you got anywhere to go?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I'm going to take your pulse.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Two of your ribs are fractured.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He isn't anybody from the village.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You can read it after lunch.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Don't you want to see Mary?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You haven't asked either of us.</span></li>

    <li><span class="sentence">Come into my office at once!</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Arthur is happy about this too.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Mr Steele has just gone home.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I‘ve just got this one letter.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I'm in no hurry at all.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I expect it's still quite warm.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now I really must go home.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">No, really, I must be off.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Saturday? That's the twenty-nineth, isn't it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, he's in hospital, isn't he?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">There's Sheila and her brother, Michael.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">After breakfast he rang Mary up.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">The others were not there yet.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It was a very hot afternoon.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">All right, then I can steer.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">We can have our picnic there.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Have you got enough room, Shelia?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Do you want some pickled onions?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Yes, there are some over there.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">No, thanks, I've got one already.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">What about Mary, Shelia? And me?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Oh, haven't you got any? Sorry.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Have you been here before, Mary?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It was you, Arthur, wasn't it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I've come for my driving lesson.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Sorry, what was your name again?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Do sit down for a minute.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You are a bit early, actually.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">How do you do, Mr Newton.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Make sure it's in neutral first.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Don't worry about reverse just yet.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I need a car like that.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">So you passed your test. Congratulations.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Nothing wrong with that, is there?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, that's out of question then.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Yes, I suppose so.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">May I look at something else?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">We've got one or two inside.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Not for you really, is it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">How much are the monthly installments?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now what about this one here?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You've got a bargain there, sir.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Yes, it doesn't seem too bad.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">So Artur now has a car.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It's a pity Mary isn't coming.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">She'll be with Bruce, I suppose.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It's a fantastic castle, isn't it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It's round the corner, isn't it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Shall I sit in front now?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, why did you come, then?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Arthur doesn't know anything about them.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Has he ever won a race?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Don't put any money on him!</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Most people are smaller than her.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, have you decided anything yet?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">So Arthur was lucky for once.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">In fact it was the worst.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It's very crowded today, isn't it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">The crowd seems to like him.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He kicked that Didcot player deliberately.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, he kicked that poor chap.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">So Arthur got a black eye.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Radios aren't allowed in the library.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">What do you think you're doing?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">This is a library, you know.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Will you come into my office!</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">They're a doctor and a teacher.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It's a postcard in my suitcase.</span></li>
