  <li><span class="sentence">It is true, I have been ill.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Why do you say I have lost my mind?</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Why do you say that I am crazy (mad)?</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I have full control of my mind?</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Don't you see that?</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Can't you see that I am NOT mad?</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">True, I have been sick.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But sickness has improved my mind. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">My mind, my senses and my feelings are stronger.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I am MORE powerful.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">My hearing is stronger.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Now, I hear sounds that I could not hear before.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I hear sounds from heaven.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I hear sounds from hell.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Listen, I will tell you how it happened.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">You will see the truth.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">You will hear how healthy my mind is.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">It is impossible to say where the idea came from.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I don't know how the idea first entered my head.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">There was no reason for what I did.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did not hate the old man;</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I even loved him.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He had never hurt me.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did not want his money.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I think it was his eye.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">His eye was like the eye of a vulture.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">A vulture is a terrible bird.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">A vulture will watch and wait while an animal dies.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">A vulture will attack the dead animal. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">A vulture will pull that dead animal to pieces to eat it.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The old man looked at me.  I saw the eye of a vulture.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">A cold feeling went up and down my back; </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I saw that eye of a vulture.  My blood became cold.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I finally decided I had to kill the old man.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I had to close that eye forever!</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">So you think that I am mad?</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">A person who is mad cannot plan. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But you should have seen me.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I was as friendly to the old man all week. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I was warm, and loving to him.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I slowly opened his door at midnight each night. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I opened the door wide enough I put my hand in.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Then, I put my head in. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I held a light in my hand.  I covered the light with a cloth.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">None of the light showed. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I stood there quietly. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I lifted the cloth, just a little.  I was very careful.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Only a single, thin light fell across that vulture eye. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did this for 7 nights.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did it for 7 long nights.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did it every night at midnight. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The eye was always closed.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">It was impossible for me to do the work. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did not feel the need to kill the old man.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I only wanted to kill the eyeâ€¦his Evil Eye. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Every morning I went to his room.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I was warm and friendly.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Each morning, I asked him how he had slept. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He had no idea that I watched him sleep every night.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He did not know that I looked in at midnight as he slept. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">On night 8 I was more careful than usual.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I opened the door carefully.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The hands of a clock moved faster than mine. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I felt my own power.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">My power had never been as strong.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I was sure I would succeed. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The old man was lying in bed.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He did not dream that I was at his door. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Suddenly he moved in his bed. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">You may think I became afraid. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But no. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The darkness in his room was thick and black. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I knew he could not see the opening of the door. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I continued to push the door open.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I moved slowly, and softly. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I put in my head. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I put in my hand.  I held the covered light. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The old man suddenly sat straight up in bed.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He cried, "Who's there??!" </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I stood quite still. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did not move for a whole hour. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did not hear him lie down in his bed again. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He just sat there, listening. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I heard a sound, a low cry of fear from the old man. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I knew that he was sitting up in his bed.  He was filled with fear. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I knew that he knew I was there. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He did not see me there. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He could not hear me there. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">He felt me there. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Now he knew that Death was standing there. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Slowly, little by little, I lifted the cloth.  A small, small light escaped from under it.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The light fell upon that vulture eye! </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">It was open -- wide, wide open.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">My anger increased.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The Evil Eye looked straight at me. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I could not see the old man's face. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I only saw that eye, that hard blue eye. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The blood in my body became like ice. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I told you that my hearing had become unusually strong? </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Now I could hear a quick, low, soft sound. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">It sounded like a clock heard through a wall. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The sound was the beating of the old man's heart. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I tried to stand quietly. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But the sound grew louder. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The old man's fear must have been great. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">As the sound grew louder I became angrier.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">My anger became more painful. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But it was more than anger. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The night was quiet.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The bedroom was dark and silent.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">My anger became fear,</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence"> The heart was beating so loudly I was sure some could hear it. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The time had come! </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I rushed into the room, yelling, "Die! Die!" </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The old man gave a loud cry of fear. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I fell upon him.  I held the bedcovers tightly over his head. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">His heart was still beating. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I smiled.  I felt that success was near. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">That heart continued to beat for many minutes; </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But at last the beating stopped. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The old man was dead. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I took away the bedcovers.  I held my ear over his heart. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">There was no sound. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Yes. He was dead! </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Dead as a stone. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">His eye would trouble me no more! </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">So I am mad, you say? </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">You should have seen how careful I was. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I put the body where no one could find it. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">First I cut off the head.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Then I cut off the arms and the legs. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I was careful.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I did not to let a single drop of blood fall on the floor. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I pulled up three of the boards from the floor.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I put the pieces of the body there. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I put the boards down again.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I replaced the boards, carefully,  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">No human eye could see the boards had been moved. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I was finishing this work. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I heard someone at the door. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">It was now four o'clock in the morning.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">It was still dark. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I went down to open the door.  I had no fear.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Three men were at the door.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">They were 3 police officers. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">One of the neighbors had heard the old man's cry.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence"> The neighbor called the police. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The officers had come to ask questions and search the house. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I asked the policemen to come in. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I told them the cry was my own.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I told the officers I had a bad dream.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The old man, I said, was away.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I told the officers the old man was visiting a friend in the country. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I took them through the whole house.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I told them to search it all, to search the house well. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I led them into the old man's bedroom. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I asked them to sit down and talk for a while. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I am playing a game with them.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I showed an easy, quiet manner.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I made the policemen believe my story. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">They sat talking with me in a friendly way. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I answered them in the same friendly way.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But, I wished they would go. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">My head hurt.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">There was a strange sound in my ears. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I talked more.  I talked faster. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The sound became clearer. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The policemen still sat and talked. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Suddenly I knew that the sound was not in my ears.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The sound was not just inside my head. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">At that moment I must have become very pale. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I talked faster and louder. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The sound became louder. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">It was a quick, low, soft sound.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The sound was like a clock heard through a wall.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I knew that sound well. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The sound got louder and louder. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Why didn't the policemen go? </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The sound got louder, louder. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I stood up quickly.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I quickly walked around the room. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I pushed my chair across the floor.  I needed to make more noise. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I made noise to cover that terrible sound. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I talked even louder. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">The policemen stayed.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">They sat and talked, and smiled. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Was it possible that they could not hear?? </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">No! They heard! I was certain of it. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">They knew! </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Now they were playing a game with me. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I was suffering more than I could bear. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I suffered because of their smiles.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I suffered because of that sound. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Louder, louder, louder! </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I could bear it any longer. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I pointed at the boards.</span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">I yelled, "Yes! Yes, I killed him. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Pull up the boards. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">You shall see! I killed him. </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">But why is his heart still beating?! </span></li>
  <li><span class="sentence">Why does it not stop!?"</span></li>
