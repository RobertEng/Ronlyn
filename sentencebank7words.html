    <li><span class="sentence">There are no lights in the house.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Come on, Mrs Harrison, open the door!</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Is there a bell? - Yes, of course.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Is it yours? - No, it isn’t mine.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now Mrs Harrison’s walking into the sitting-room.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">In his dream Arthur’s got a car.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Bruce isn’t driving the car; Arthur is.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It’s a beautiful day and Arthur’s happy.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Arthur and Mary are librarians in Middleford.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He’s coming out of the water now.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He has some books in his hand.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">They’re sending another box of books tomorrow.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Mary, come here. - Coming, Mr Steele.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It is now a quarter past nine.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He cannot get up in the morning.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">’I must find them,’ he is thinking.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Oh dear, the bus is not stopping.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Arthur is looking through the library window.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He isn’t late today - he’s early.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">This morning he has time for breakfast.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now Mrs Harrison’s bringing in the post.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">How much is the fare to Applefield?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">There’s only one girl in this room.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">We're going to her aunt's in London.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">How many stops are there before London?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I've only got one pair of hands.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now Bob is talking to the porter.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Is that for me? What is it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I’m a student. I’m at London University.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">This is Bob. Bob, this is Mary.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">She’s got your bag and your overcoat.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I sometimes see him in the summer.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">There’s a young man in the car.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Don’t come anywhere near the car, please!</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Can you hold this torch for me?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now, can somebody give me my bag?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now it’s eleven o’clock on Sunday morning.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He has not even had a shave.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">What are you doing with that paper?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Sheila, what do you want to drink?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Just a sweet sherry for me, please.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I’m going to have a tomato juice.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">James, of course, is still in hospital.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now Mr Steele has just come in.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He hasn’t gone into his office yet</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Have you been here since nine o’clock?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, 5 days, that’s nearly a week.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Come into my office for a minute.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, you haven’t sent me an email.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Last weekend in Applefield Arthur was broke.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It was the end of the month.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">We can go home now, can’t we?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">There were a lot of people in.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, it’s a lovely evening, isn’t it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">We must both work tomorrow, mustn’t we?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">That was very nice of you, Arthur.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Arthur got up early on Saturday morning.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He wanted to hear the weather forecast.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I can row first if you like.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I’m not too big, am I, Arthur?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Perhaps it’s time to go back now.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It’s a bit cloudy too, isn’t it?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Mary didn’t even say goodnight to Arthur.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You gave it to me on Monday.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Did you ever learn about the controls?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">What do you think of that one?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I must say it looks very nice.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">A bit too much for you, perhaps?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I can see you’ve got the taste.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">That’s only three thousand, five hundred pounds.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It goes well. That’s the main thing.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Charlie, come over here for a minute.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You want to buy that, do you?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Why not drive it round the block?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He needn’t go by train this time.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He told her about his ‘new’ car.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Now where did we put the car?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I’ll sit in front because I’m navigating.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Well, personally, I think it’s very nice.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Look, it says Swanage - two miles.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Arthur’s car was at the police station.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">That’s him over there, the grey one.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He’s the nicest horse I’ve ever seen.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I like ’Darling Mary’. (a horse’s name)</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">We can see the race better there.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You haven’t got much farther to go.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It’s the slowest horse in the race.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Didcot’s nearer to Applefield than Middleford is.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I was talking to my friend, actually.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">What did you say about our Fred?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It was a brief moment of joy.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Mary was also working in the library.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">You see, I thought I was lucky.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I have a flat and a house.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I have a map in my notebook.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I'm married and I have two children.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I live in the south of Hungary.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I want to drink a cold tea.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I have a niece and a nephew.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">What are you doing in the afternoon?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">When will you come and see us?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">He has two hours to get here.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Have you ever seen a big plane?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I have to speak to the receptionist.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">What the hell are you doing here?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I need to have a hobby.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I don’t want you to be late.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I never drink alcohol when I drive.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">It’s very windy now – let’s go sailing!</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">This is one of my favourite songs.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">In winter I love having hot baths.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Do you know what is behind you?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">In my room the carpet is grey.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">When were you last at the chemist's?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Do you wake up by an alarm-clock?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I was very happy during the weekend.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">My friend would like to be famous.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I can't find food in the fridge.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">How often are you in your kitchen?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Are you a member of the library?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">There isn't a mirror in my room.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">My radio-reading lamp-alarm clock is very modern.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I haven't been to a big palace.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">There are six pictures on our wall.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">This is a great place in summer.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">We have a sofa opposite the tv.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I got a stereo for my birthday.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">My cat likes sitting on my table.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Do you know the new car-racing champion?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Tell me where the check-in desk is.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">I can't answer you this question fluently.</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Who is that man at the gate?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">Can you hear me in this noise?</span></li>
    <li><span class="sentence">How much did you earn last month?</span></li>
